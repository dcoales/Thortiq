# Multi-pane Outline Verification

## Automated checks
- `npm run lint`
- `npm run typecheck`
- `npm test`

## Manual notes
- Confirmed modifier clicks on bullets open/focus neighbour panes while the shared editor tracks the active pane.
- Verified close button remains disabled when only one pane exists and that panes clean up hover overlays when closed.

Future iterations should include responsive layout smoke checks (stacked mode, gutter resizing) once the UI work for those flows lands.*** End Patch
